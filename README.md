Instructions for running the simulation:
1. Open Eclipse project folder by File -> Open project from file system.
Make sure that the folder that import directly contains all the folders such as spec, src, etc. and does not contain a folder that contains them.
2. Within the src folder under smartHome, there is a java file called smartHome.java, in order to run the simulation, open it and press the run button.
A window will open containing the simulation. From the window you can view a random simulation, select the input fot the environment variables and run the scenarios from the requirements document.

It is important to remember to produce symbolic controller from the spectra file before running the simulation.
